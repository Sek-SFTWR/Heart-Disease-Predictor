# Heart-Disease-Predictor

This project is based on AI and aims to predict heart disease using specific data. It leverages a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the primary machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Noisy data is preprocessed to ensure better model performance.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for its efficiency and accuracy in classification problems.
- **Data Types Included**:  
  - Preprocessed data (cleaned and prepared for training and testing).  
  - Noisy data (raw data for reference and preprocessing).  

## Repository Contents

- **Preprocessed Data**: Includes cleaned datasets ready for training and testing.
- **Noisy Data**: Raw datasets before preprocessing for comparison.
- **Model Implementation**: SVM implementation in a machine learning framework.
